# Fake News Classification

This repository contains a project focused on classifying news articles as either reliable or potentially unreliable (fake news). The project utilizes a dataset consisting of news articles with associated attributes such as id, title, author, text, and label.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes the following files:

### `train.csv`

A full training dataset with the following attributes:

- **id**: Unique identifier for a news article.
- **title**: The title of a news article.
- **author**: The author of the news article.
- **text**: The text of the article, which could be incomplete.
- **label**: A label that marks the article as potentially unreliable.
  - **1**: Unreliable (potentially fake news).
  - **0**: Reliable.

### `test.csv`

A testing dataset with the same attributes as `train.csv`, except for the absence of the label column. This dataset is used for evaluating the trained model's performance.

## Approach

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict whether a news article is reliable or potentially unreliable. The provided Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of this classification task using machine learning techniques.

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Loading the training and testing datasets.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for training the classification model.
3. Feature Extraction: Transforming the textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
4. Model Training: Training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Predictions: Generating predictions on new, unseen data using the trained model.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Other libraries as mentioned in the notebook (if any)

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install jupyter pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the notebook (`fake-news-Classification.ipynb`) directly.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook on your machine using the command `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the notebook (`fake-news-Classification.ipynb`) in your Jupyter Notebook interface.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and understand the different steps involved in fake news classification.
6. Modify and experiment with the code as desired to apply the concepts to your own classification tasks or datasets.
